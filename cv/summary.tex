Professional Software Engineer with experience in the general areas of parallel
and distributed computing. Specifically, my technical skills focuses in design
and optimizations in the following areas:
(i)   distributed parallel programming models and runtime systems for HPC (MPI
      and OpenSHMEM) and ML (NCCL/RCCL);
(ii)  parallel computing architectures, and
(iii) high-speed network interconnects (HPE Slingshot and Nvidia Infiniband).
